##TODO 1 - Inheritance##

In the following location please implement the SuperHero class so that it makes the Person class a mutable class.
You will find extra description inside the class.

Also because you have HTTP/TCP communication and some serializers need it and also for good practice 
try to declare also the default constructor.
