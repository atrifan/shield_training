 * This class needs to inherit the person class from `training-model`
 * Tip: you are using maven, first you must import your dependency module
 * You must use overloading and overriding - on whatever method you want.
 *
 * You must be able to set a new name for the person, have a setter a getter,
 * alter constructor - changing the Person from immutable to mutable
